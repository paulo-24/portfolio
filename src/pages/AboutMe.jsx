        Hi, I’m John Paulo Abrajano you can call me Paulo or Pau. I started my journey as a
        backend developer, but along the way, I discovered a deep passion for UI/UX design.
        I found myself drawn to the process of crafting interfaces that are not only functional
        but also visually engaging and intuitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        What excites me most is the balance between creativity and problem-solving—
        turning complex ideas into seamless user experiences. I’m now shifting my focus
        toward designing with the user in mind, and I’m eager to keep learning, creating,
        and growing in this space.
      </p>
