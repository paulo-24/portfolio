      <p>
        Hi, Im Paulo Abrajano, and Im 22 years old. I have a variety of interests, 
        including playing online games and basketball. I also enjoy adventure activities 
        like hiking and camping, as they help me stay healthy and complete my day. In the field 
        of programming, I work as a back-end developer, and I consider myself a beginner, 
        still learning and growing. Iâ€™m also exploring my interests, as I have a passion for design. 
        It is possible that I may shift towards UI/UX design or front-end development in the future.
      </p>
